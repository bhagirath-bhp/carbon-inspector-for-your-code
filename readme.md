# EcoCode Analyzer

Welcome to EcoCode Analyzer, a web-based tool that helps you analyze the environmental impact of your code!

## Motivation

In today's world, where sustainability is increasingly important, understanding the environmental impact of our actions, including software development, is crucial. Code execution contributes to carbon emissions due to the energy consumption of servers and data centers. As programmers, we have the responsibility to develop code that is not only efficient in terms of performance but also in terms of its carbon footprint.

### Why Carbon Efficiency Matters

Every line of code we write can have a tangible impact on the environment. Consider this:
- **Carbon Emissions:** Each execution of code consumes energy, which translates into carbon emissions. Even small optimizations can reduce the overall environmental impact.
- **Sustainability:** By writing more carbon-efficient code, developers can contribute to reducing the environmental footprint of software and IT infrastructure globally.

### Understanding Carbon Efficiency

To understand the carbon efficiency of your code, consider a simple metric:
- **Carbon Efficiency Score:** This is a measure of how much carbon emissions (in grams of CO2 equivalent) your code produces per unit of performance (e.g., per function call, per second of execution). The lower the score, the more carbon-efficient your code is.

## Features

- **Code Input:** Enter your code snippet and analyze its performance and carbon emissions.
- **Execution Time:** See how long your code takes to execute in milliseconds.
- **CPU Load:** Monitor the CPU load percentage during code execution.
- **Memory Usage:** Check the memory usage of your code in megabytes.
- **Carbon Emissions:** Understand the carbon footprint of your code in grams of CO2 equivalent.

## How It Works

EcoCode Analyzer uses modern web technologies to provide real-time analysis of your code snippets:

1. **Input Code:** Paste your code snippet into the provided text area.
2. **Analyze:** Click the "Analyze" button to start processing your code.
3. **Results:** Instantly view the execution time, CPU load, memory usage, and carbon emissions produced by your code.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** (Mention any backend technologies or services used, if applicable)

## Usage

To use EcoCode Analyzer, follow these steps:

1. Open the website in your browser.
2. Paste your code snippet into the input area.
3. Click the "Analyze" button.
4. Review the results displayed for execution time, CPU load, memory usage, and carbon emissions.
